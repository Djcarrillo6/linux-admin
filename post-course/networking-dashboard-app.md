# Network Monitoring Dashboard

## Concept:
Build a comprehensive dashboard for real-time monitoring of network traffic and connections on a Unix systems. The dashboard will leverage tools like `netstat`, `ss`, and `nmap` to provide detailed insights into network activity. Users will be able to visualize open ports, active connections, network scans, and more.

## Key Features:
1. **Real-Time Network Traffic Monitoring:**
   - Display current network traffic, including active connections and data transfer rates.
   - Visualize inbound and outbound traffic on each network interface.

2. **Open Ports and Services:**
   - List all open ports and the services listening on them.
   - Highlight critical ports commonly associated with security vulnerabilities.

3. **Active Connections Visualization:**
   - Show active TCP and UDP connections.
   - Display connection details such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, and connection states.

4. **Network Scanning and Analysis:**
   - Integrate `nmap` to perform network scans.
   - Provide detailed reports on discovered devices, open ports, and running services.

5. **Alerts and Notifications:**
   - Set up alerts for specific network events, such as new open ports or unexpected traffic spikes.
   - Send notifications via email or SMS for critical alerts.

6. **Historical Data and Trends:**
   - Store historical network data for trend analysis.
   - Display trends and patterns in network activity over time.

7. **Customizable Dashboard:**
   - Allow users to customize the dashboard layout and select the metrics they want to monitor.
   - Provide multiple views, such as summary, detailed, and graphical representations.

## Technologies:
- **Frontend:** React for building a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Backend:** .NET Core for handling data processing, API creation, and user authentication.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for storing network data, configuration settings, and historical logs.
- **Visualization:** Grafana for creating detailed graphs and visualizations.
- **Network Tools:** Integration with `netstat`, `ss`, and `nmap` for gathering network information.
- **Alerts:** Integration with a notification service (e.g., Twilio for SMS, SendGrid for email).
- **Real-Time Updates:** SignalR for real-time communication between backend and frontend.
