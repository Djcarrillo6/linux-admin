**Section 14: Challenges - Network Interfaces**
  ## How to solve these challenges:
  - To be consistent with the filenames and paths run the commands on Ubuntu
  - Write your solution in a terminal and test it.
  - If your solution is not correct, then try to understand the error messages, watch the video again, rewrite the solution, and test it again. Repeat this step until you get the correct solution.
  - Save the solution in a file for future reference or recap.
